    An Aura component represents a unit of a page. 
    An independant block of reusable code, wrapped 
    up so that it works well on it's own or together with 
    other components. 

    <p>Specify a component source and you can just start
    including them in your page on demand
    with data attributes.</p>

    Aura Events give components a rich way to communicate between each other
    at a global or local level. Subscribe, unsubscribe and emit sandboxed event notifications.

    <p>An Aura sandbox is the layer between you and your library.
    It gives you the flexibility to switch our libraries with greater ease.</p>

'Extension':

  description: |
    Aura Extensions help you extend the core capabilities of your app 
    before any of your components load. Want to ensure all of them have 
    access to a particular library, like Backbone or API wrapper like GitHub? 

    <p>It'll make them available via the component's sandbox so you don't have
    to worry about importing and setting this up yourself.</p>
