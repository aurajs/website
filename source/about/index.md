Aura is an **event-driven extensible architecture for wrapping your code into reusable components and extensions that can easily communicate with each other.**
 
Aura works great with **existing** frameworks like [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) or [Ember](http://emberjs.com), but is framework-agnostic, adapting many best-practice patterns for developing maintainable applications.

Aura has first-class support for modern tools like [Bower](http://bower.io), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and uses libraries like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) under the covers (for now). As solutions like ES6 modules and [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org) become stable and usable, the project will move towards using them.

## Components

A component is something **[atomic](http://juristr.com/blog/2013/04/modularity-in-javascript-frameworks/)** with a clear responsibility. A mini-app basically that can be instantiated (possibly multiple times) on an arbitrary part of your application. You might not be accustomed to thinking like this, preferring to build a highly coupled app. That might work just fine initially, but once it gets more complex you can run into trouble. Therefore, next time when you start building something bigger, stop for a moment and try to identify possible components.

Consider for example GitHub’s site:

<img src="images/docs/github.jpg"/>

Separating your application into smaller parts is essential for keeping your architecture clean, reusable and mainly maintainable. The principle is a known concept in computer science: “divide and conquer”. Divide everything up into smaller parts which have lower complexity, are easier to test and cause fewer headaches. Then compose them together to form your larger application.

### But Wait: My Components Have to Communicate!

Aura Components within your application need to communicate with each other. Such communication creates dependencies as component A needs to have a reference to component B if it needs to invoke some operation on it, right? Well, not necessarily, as that would again couple those components together and you couldn’t exchange component B arbitrarily without having to also change component A.

Therefore, a common practice for creating a modular architecture is to decouple communication among components through event broadcasting mechanisms. Aura comes with global and component-level messaging patterns, making this a breeze.

## A Quick Example

### How does it work?

To build your app, you can assemble components via AuraJS's HTML API, by using the `data-aura-*` attributes.

Let's take an example. Let's say that we want to build a Github Issues app. We need to be able to:

* Display lists of issues from specific repos
* Filter those issues

Now let's make some components, but first we need a way to talk to [Github's API](http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/).

Here is a simple [AuraJS extension](/getting-started#extending-aura) that does just that:

**extensions/aura-github.js**

```js
define({
  initialize: function (app) {
    app.sandbox.github = function (path, verb, data) {
      var dfd = $.Deferred();
      var token = app.config.github.token;
      verb = verb || 'get';
      if (data && verb != 'get') {
        data = JSON.stringify(data);
      }
      $.ajax({
        type: verb,
        url: 'https://api.github.com/' + path,
        data: data,
        headers: {
          "Authorization": "token " + token
        },
        success: dfd.resolve,
        error: dfd.reject
      });
      return dfd;
    };
  }
});
```

This extension exposes in all our components a way to talk to Github's API via the `this.sandbox.github` method.

To use it in your aura app:

**app.js**

```js
require(['aura'], function(Aura) {
  var app = new Aura({
    github: { token: 'current-user-token-here' }
  });
  app.use('extensions/aura-github');
  app.start('body');
})
```

And now, let's write the issues` component:

**aura_components/issues/main.js**

```js
define(['underscore', 'text!./issues.html'], function(_, tpl) {

  template = _.template(customTemplate.html());

  return {
    initialize: function() {
      _.bindAll(this);
      this.repo   = this.options.repo;
      this.filter = this.options.filter || {};
      this.sandbox.on('issues.filter', this.fetch, this);
      this.fetch();
    },
    fetch: function(filter) {
      this.filter = _.extend(this.filter, filter || {});
      var path = 'repos/' + this.repo + '/issues';
      return this.sandbox.github(path, 'get', this.filter).then(this.render);
    },
    render: function(issues) {
      this.html(template({
        issues: issues,
        filter: this.filter,
        repo: this.repo
      }));
    }
  };
});
```

Now we can place this component everywhere in our app by using Aura's HTML API based on data-attributes.
`this.options.filter` and `this.options.repo` can be passed to our component via the `data-aura-repo` and `data-aura-filter` attributes.

```html
<div data-aura-component="issues" data-aura-repo="aurajs/aura"></div>
```

You can even have multiple instances of this component in you page:


```html
<div data-aura-component="issues" data-aura-repo="aurajs/aura"></div>
<div data-aura-component="issues" data-aura-repo="emberjs/ember"></div>
<div data-aura-component="issues" data-aura-repo="documentcloud/backbone"></div>
```

Any other component can now emit `issues.filter`  events that these components will respond to.
For example in another component that will allow the user to filter the issues lists, we can have:

```js
this.sandbox.emit('issues.filter', { state: 'closed' });
```

You can find a [Github client demo app based on AuraJS + a bunch of Github components here](http://github.com/sbellity/aura-github).
